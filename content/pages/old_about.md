Let me tell you a bit more about myself and how I got to be where I am today.

Originally hailing from the great state of Ohio, I turned east for college. I spent four years in Philadelphia at The Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2011, I graduated magna cum laude with studies in statistics, economics, mathematics, and finance. Following graduation, I moved to New York where I began my career at BlackRock, the world's largest financial asset manager. While at BlackRock, I helped some of the largest commercial banks in the United States to value and stress test their financial portfolios. 

From BlackRock, I moved on to Orchard, a financial analytics startup, and I ultimately became the head of the research team. I analyzed the vast amounts of data that Orchard ingested on a daily basis to produce cogent, actionable insights for our clients. The content that I created directly established Orchard as the leading analytics and data company in the Alternative Lending industry. Check out the [Published Writing Page]({filename}./writing.md) of this site for a sample of some of the work I created while at Orchard.

Throughout my career, my focus has been to break down highly technical ideas into easily digestible pieces, then weave those pieces into a clear narrative. I seek to understand problems at the deepest level, always asking "why" to gain further insight. This degree of focus lets me dissect complex ideas and explain highly technical concepts to broad audiences. I use analytical programming tools to create beautiful data visualizations and graphics that present my conclusions. I do the majority of my day-to-day work and analyses using R and Linux command-line tools, but I also have experience with the Python data science stack. I'm always experimenting with new workflows and tools, and I love to talk about them. Hit me up on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Michael_Toth" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if you want to chat!

Outside of work, I enjoy hanging out in coffee shops, making craft cocktails, playing squash, and lifting weights. I love to talk about my hobbies, so definitely <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Michael_Toth" target="_blank">reach out</a> if we share the same interests!

I publish all of my R-related blog posts on <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/" target="_blank">R-Bloggers</a> where you'll also find a ton of amazing R content from other users. This is a go-to resource of mine, definitely check it out if you haven't already!
