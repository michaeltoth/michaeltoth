Title: Books
Status: hidden

In a culture increasingly driven by quick hits of information on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, I am a strong believer in the value of dedicating long chunks of time to digest information from a single source. I spend a good amount of my time reading every day, and I think that this makes me a better programmer, a more nuanced thinker, and a more well rounded person.

In this page I'm including a list of books that have influenced my programming skills and my thinking. Primarily these are programming books and business books. I also am including a list of books I am currently reading.

Some of the links on this page are affiliate links. An affiliate link means I may earn a commission if you make a purchase through my link, *without any extra cost to you*. It helps me keep this blog running. Thank you for your support.
