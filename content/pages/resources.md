# The Tools You Need to Take Your Data Science Learning and Career to the Next Level

My resources section is a curated list of the tools and websites I strongly recommend for learning analytics and building a data science career. I have tested every recommendation on this page. Many of the resources listed here have been and continue to be crucial to my growth as a data scientist. 

Before digging into these awesome resources, an important disclosure:

Some of the links below are affiliate links, which means that if you choose to make a purchase, I will earn a commission. This commission comes at no extra cost to you. I have experience with all of these companies and products, and I recommend them because they are helpful and useful, not because of the small commissions I make if you purchase something. Please do not spend any money on these products unless you feel you need them or that they will help you achieve your goals.

# Recommended Books

In a culture increasingly driven by quick hits of information on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, I am a strong believer in the value of focus. Focused reading of a single topic is still the best way to understand something deeply. I spend a good amount of my time reading every day, and I think that this makes me a better programmer, a more nuanced thinker, and a more well rounded person.

The books below are my top recommendations for learning R, statistics, and data visualization. I am also including books that I believe are good resources to help you interview, get a new job, and grow your career.
