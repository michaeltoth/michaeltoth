### Before you go, let's talk about resources

Did you know that one of my most popular pages is my Resources page? 

The Resources page is a collection of some of my all-time favorite and most useful books, podcasts, tools, and software to help you master R and grow your income, no matter what level you’re at. It’s always being updated, and here for you when you need it.
