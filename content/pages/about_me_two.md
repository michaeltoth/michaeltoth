#I'm Michael Toth.

###I'm a writer and data science consultant.

Here are some of the places my data science writing has been featured.

These days, I'm focused on 3 things:

# It's been a long road getting to where I am today

Originally hailing from the great state of Ohio, I turned east for college. I spent four years in Philadelphia at The Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2011, I graduated magna cum laude with studies in statistics, economics, mathematics, and finance. 

Then I moved to New York where I began my career at BlackRock, the world's largest financial asset manager. While at BlackRock, I helped some of the largest commercial banks in the United States to value and stress test their financial portfolios. It was everything I'd ever dreamed of. Except, it wasn't. I wasn't challenged, and after a while I didn't feel like I was growing my skills.

I decided I needed a change. So I spent my nights and weekends studying R programming and figuring out how to become a data scientist. 

At some point during these studies, with no particular goals in mind, I started this blog. That decision has been by far the best decision of my career.

Because I latched onto something that is easy to forget when your head is down studying. You don't need to be a world-class expert to get a job as a data scientist. You just need to be able to do the things expected of you in your particular role.

When I was looking for my next job, I found Orchard, a company doing online lending analytics, which was similar to what I already had experience with at BlackRock. I found a public data set, analyzed some interesting findings, and wrote up a post about it on this blog. Now, I think of it as [the blog post that launched my career](https://michaeltoth.me/analyzing-historical-default-rates-of-lending-club-notes.html), because that blog post secured me a job at Orchard.

Getting that first full-time job as a data scientist was what it took to really take my skills to the next level. But I was always careful to optimize my learning for the most important things to move my career and skillset forward. 

# I'm not a "business" expert or a 10x developer

I don't know everything. 

If you want to understand the cutting edge machine learning models or understand parameter tuning your neural network, you're not going to find it here.

But if you want to master the core skills you need to become a data scientist, learn the skills to market yourself and grow your data science career, then I can help you.

I'm a master of cutting away the bullshit that doesn't matter to get to the core of an issue.

If you're still with me, thank you. You're clearly committed to improving as a data scientist. Sign up below to follow along:
