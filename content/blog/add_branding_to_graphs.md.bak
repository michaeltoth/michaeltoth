In today's post I want to help you incorporate your company's branding into your ggplot graphs. Why should you care about this? I'm glad you asked!

Have you ever seen a graph that looks like this? Of course you have! This is the default ggplot theme, and these graphs are everywhere. Now, look--I like the way this graph looks. The base ggplot theme is reasonable and the graph is clear. But it doesn't in any way differentiate it from thousands of other, similarly designed graphs on the internet. That's not good. You want your graphs to stand out! Take a look at this next graph:

I'm guessing, even before you saw the caption at the bottom, that you knew this was a graph from FiveThirtyEight, Nate Silver's data-driven news service.

How about this one?

Again, this graph is immediately recognizable as coming from the Economist magazine. These two companies have done exceptional jobs of creating branded, differentiating styles to make their graphics immediately recognizable to anybody who sees them. In this post, I'm going to convince you why it's important that you develop a branded style for your graphs at your own company, and then I'll show you some quick steps to do it. 

Now, I know, You might be thinking: branding and visual identity is something for the design and marketing teams to worry about. You're a data scientist! You don't have those skills, and, frankly, you have more important things to do. I sympathize, but I'm going to be honest with you: you need to get that idea out of your head. It's easier than you think, and it's part of your job! Or, at least, it should be. You see, when you start to make YOUR work fit in with YOUR COMPANY'S work, doors start to open for you. You create more for cross-departmental and external facing opportunities when your work clearly matches the company brand. Maybe a graph you created can help the sales team put together a presentation to win a big client. Maybe the marketing team can use your work to help put together a press kit. These probably aren't the core focus of your job, but the more you help people around your organization, the more respected you'll be and the more opportunities you'll have. 

Over time, you will build a reputation and be recognized for your quality work because your work will be VISIBLE. Pretty soon, you will be the go-to person when an executive needs a graph for a board presentation or an investor pitch. As you build more relationships throughout your company, you'll be able to direct your focus to work that you enjoy, get involved in interesting projects, and advocate for projects of your own. And the best part? Most of this is completely passive! You're already doing the work, these tips will just help you to make it more visible, more shareable, and more impactful!

Convinced? Okay, let's get started. This is going to be one of the easiest high-impact changes you can make, so I hope you're excited!

I'm going to show you how you can easily change the color palette of a graph and add your company's logo to create a final, branded image that's ready for publication. 

To start, create a standard ggplot graph like you otherwise would:
