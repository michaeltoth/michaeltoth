Globally, R users in the Stack Overflow developer survey report earning $64k per year, $1k more than the $63k reported by Python developers. In the United States, that situation reverses, with Python programmers earning $116k and R programmers $108k.

## The Stack Overflow Developer Survey

Since 2011, Stack Overflow has been surveying their users each year to answer questions about the technologies they use, their work experience, their compensation, and their satisfaction at work. Given Stack Overflow's place in the broader programming world, they are able to draw quite the audience for their annual surveys. 

They themselves note that "Stack Overflowâ€™s annual Developer Survey is the largest and most comprehensive survey of people who code around the world"

This year, nearly 90,000 developers participated in the [2019 developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019)!

There's a lot in this survey, and I recommend reviewing it yourself, but I wanted to surface some of the key findings that I thought were particularly relevant to data professionals here.

## Developer Profile

People with all different types of coding backgrounds use Stack Overflow. While most of them identify as developers (just over 51.9% globally identify as full-stack developers), there are also a significant number of data professionals on the list (a term I've just invented to include the categories database administrator, data scienctist, data analyst, and data engineer).

###### Developer Roles

Global:
Database administrator: 11.7%
Data scientist or machine learning specialist: 7.9%
Data or business analyst: 7.7%
Engineer, data: 7.2%

United States:
Database administrator: 12.1%
Data or business analyst 9.0%
Data scientist or machine learning specialist 8.7%
Engineer, data8.4%

Note that these figures are not mutually exclusive, as people can identify as more than 1 type of developer

###### Experience

Years of Professional Coding Experience by Developer Type

Data or business analyst9.3
Engineer, data8.6
Data scientist or machine learning specialist7.8


Perhaps comment on undergraduate major (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-undergraduate-major) and prevalence of business/statistics people. Probably underweighted for data scientists, but I thought it was interesting as somebody with a finance & statistics background.
