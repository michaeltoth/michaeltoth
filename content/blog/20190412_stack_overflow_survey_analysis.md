At least globally, that is. According to the [2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019), R users globally reported earning an average of $64k per year, $1k more than the $63k reported by Python developers. In the United States, that situation reverses, with Python programmers earning $116k and R programmers $108k.

## The Stack Overflow Developer Survey

Since 2011, Stack Overflow has been surveying their users each year to answer questions about the technologies they use, their work experience, their compensation, and their satisfaction at work. Given Stack Overflow's place in the broader programming world, they are able to draw quite the audience for their annual surveys. 

This year, nearly 90,000 developers participated in the survey! There's a lot in this survey, and I recommend reviewing it yourself, but I wanted to surface some of the key findings that I thought were particularly relevant to data professionals here.

## Developer Profile

People with all different types of coding backgrounds use Stack Overflow. While most of them identify as developers (just over 51.9% globally identify as full-stack developers), there are also a significant number of data professionals on the list (a term I've just invented to include the categories database administrator, data scienctist, data analyst, and data engineer).

###### Developer Roles
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{filename}/images/20190412_Stack_Overflow/Global_Developer_Roles.png" width="350"></p>

Globally, 11.7% of Stack Overflow users surveyed identified as database administrators, 7.9% as data scientists or machine learning specialists, 7.7% as data/business analysts, and 7.2% as data engineers. These figures were slightly higher for US-based respondents to the survey.

Note that these figures are not mutually exclusive, as people were able to select multiple options in the survey

###### United States Average Salaries by Job
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{filename}/images/20190412_Stack_Overflow/US_Average_Salaries_By_Job.png" width="350"></p>

Average salaries by job were reported to be something or another

###### Years of Experience
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{filename}/images/20190412_Stack_Overflow/Years_Of_Experience.png" width="350"></p>

In the survey, data and business analysts reported an average of 9.3 years of professional coding experience, while data scientists reported an average of 7.8 years of experience. I thought this was particularly interesting in light of the fact that average salaries for data scientists were approximately $20k higher than those of data analysts ____

Perhaps comment on undergraduate major (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-undergraduate-major) and prevalence of business/statistics people. Probably underweighted for data scientists, but I thought it was interesting as somebody with a finance & statistics background.

## Technology

###### Programming, Scripting, and Markup Languages Used
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{filename}/images/20190412_Stack_Overflow/Tools_Used.png" width="350"></p>

SQL was by far the most popular data technology, at 54.4%. This is to be expected given its broad use in business applications and its long history. Python clocked in at 41.7%, though as a general purpose programming language the majority of those users are likely not using Python for its data processing in particular. R came in at 5.8% usage in the survey.

I recommend you check out the survey for a bunch of other useful information. There's information on database usage, machine learning frameworks, and ####, as well as general information on work environments, developer satisfaction, and much more!


###### Looking for Jobs
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{filename}/images/20190412_Stack_Overflow/Looking_For_Jobs.png" width="350"></p>

In general, data professionals seem to be looking for jobs a bit more actively than other fields


###### Training
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="{filename}/images/20190412_Stack_Overflow/Training.png" width="350"></p>

I thought this was particularly interesting given my background as a student of finance and statistics. My programming skills are largely self-taught, having only taken 2 programming classes during my time in college.
